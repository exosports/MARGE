\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:theory}

\noindent This document describes MARGE, the Machine learning Algorithm for Radiative 
transfer of Generated Exoplanets.  MARGE generates exoplanet spectra; processes 
them into a desired format; and trains, validates, and tests neural network (NN)
models to approximate radiative transfer (RT).  At present, MARGE is configured 
to use BART, the Bayesian Atmospheric Radiative Transfer code, for spectra 
generation.

The detailed MARGE code documentation and User Manual\footnote{Most recent version of the manual available at 
\href{https://exosports.github.io/MARGE/doc/MARGE_User_Manual.html}{https://exosports.github.io/MARGE/doc/MARGE\_User\_Manual.html}} 
are provided with the package to assist users in its usage. 
For additional support, contact the lead author (see Section \ref{sec:team}).

\section{Installation}
\label{sec:installation}

\subsection{System Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}

\noindent MARGE was developed on a Unix/Linux machine using the following 
versions of packages:

\begin{itemize}
\item Python 3.7.2
\item Keras 2.2.4
\item Numpy 1.16.2
\item Matplotlib 3.0.2
\item mpi4py 3.0.3
\item Scipy 1.2.1
\item sklearn 0.20.2
\item Tensorflow 1.13.1
\item CUDA 9.1.85
\item cuDNN 7.5.00
\item ONNX 1.6.0
\item keras2onnx 1.6.1
\item onnx2keras 0.0.22
\end{itemize}

\noindent MARGE also requires a working MPI distribution if using BART for 
data generation.  MARGE was developed using MPICH version 3.3.2.



\subsection{Install and Compile}
\label{sec:install}

\subsubsection{Unix}

\noindent This is our recommended installation method.  The following 
instructions have been verified on Ubuntu and may need to be slightly modified 
for other Unix distributions (e.g., Mac).

\noindent To begin, obtain the latest stable version of MARGE.  Decide on a 
local directory to hold MARGE.  Let the path to this directory be 
MARGE. Now, clone the repository:
\begin{verbatim}
git clone --recursive https://github.com/exosports/MARGE MARGE/
cd MARGE/
\end{verbatim}

\noindent MARGE contains a file to easily build a conda environment capable of 
executing the software.  Create the environment via
\begin{verbatim}
conda env create -f environment.yml
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Then, activate the environment:
\begin{verbatim}
conda activate marge
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Users that do not have Nvidia GPU drivers installed will need to 
remove the tensorflow-gpu package:
\begin{verbatim}
conda remove -n marge tensorflow-gpu
\end{verbatim}
\noindent Follow the prompt to upgrade/downgrade relevant packages.

\noindent You are now ready to run MARGE!

\noindent Data generation with BART requires SWIG.  For users that do not 
already have it installed, it can be easily installed via conda:
\begin{verbatim}
conda install swig
\end{verbatim}

\noindent To use BART, its submodules must be compiled:
\begin{verbatim}
make bart
\end{verbatim}

\noindent You are now ready to run MARGE with BART!


\subsubsection{Mac}

Mac users can follow the above Unix instructions to set up the conda 
environment.  However, Mac has certain libraries installed by default that 
can conflict with a related library within the conda environment.  This can 
produce some concerning Runtime Warnings when executing MARGE.  After setting 
up the environment and activating it as detailed above, enter 
\begin{verbatim}
conda install nomkl
\end{verbatim}
\noindent into the terminal.  This will solve the problem.


\subsubsection{Windows}

\noindent Windows is not yet fully supported.  We advise that Windows 10 users 
follow the Unix instructions using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which 
provides a Bash terminal.

\noindent The BART compilation scripts require a C compiler (e.g., gcc).  
Additionally, some of the compilation scripts are intended to use Bash.  
Problems can arise due to the return character used in Windows, so users may 
need to make use of a utility that converts line endings.  

\noindent If a user finds a method to run MARGE in Windows, we encourage them 
to share their installation method to improve the documentation.



\section{Example}
\label{sec:example}

\noindent The following script will walk a user through executing all modes of 
MARGE to simulate the emission spectra of an HD 189733 b-like exoplanet with a 
variety of thermal profiles and atmospheric compositions, process the data, and 
train an NN model to quickly approximate spectra over the trained parameter 
space.  These instructions are meant to be executed from a Linux terminal.  

We offer a lightweight example meant to be executed on a machine with 4 cores 
and 6 GB of RAM.  Note that we are compromising the completeness and accuracy 
of the resulting model to ensure that the software can be executed in a 
reasonable amount of time (though it will still take a while!).  To improve 
the results, users may increase the number of spectra generated (numit in BART 
config), use a finer opacity grid (reduce tempdelt and wndelt in BART config), 
increase the number of atmospheric layers (n\_layers in BART config), and/or 
use a more complicated model architecture (more layers, more nodes).

\noindent Requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textgreater= 4 cores
\item \textgreater= 4 GB RAM available (recommended system RAM \textgreater= 6 GB)
\item \textgreater= 20 GB free space
\end{itemize}

\noindent Optional:
\begin{itemize}
\item GPU with \textgreater= 4 GB RAM
\end{itemize}

\noindent To begin, copy the requisite files to another directory.  Here we 
assume that directory is parallel to MARGE, called run.  From the MARGE 
directory,
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir ../run
cp -a ./example/* ../run/.
cd ../run
\end{verbatim}

\noindent To generate data with BART, a Transit Line-Information (TLI) file 
containing all line list information must be created.  Download the required 
line lists and create the TLI file (this may take a while!):
\begin{verbatim}
./get_lists.sh
../MARGE/modules/BART/modules/transit/pylineread/src/pylineread.py -c pylineread.cfg
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Now, execute MARGE:
\begin{verbatim}
../MARGE/MARGE.py MARGE.cfg
\end{verbatim}

\noindent This will take some time to run.  It will 

\begin{itemize}
\item generate an opacity table,
\item run BART to generate spectra,
\item process the generated spectra into MARGE's desired format,
\item train, validate, and test an NN model, and
\item plot specific predicted vs. true spectra.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Users can disable some steps via boolean flags within the configuration file.  
For details, see the following section.


\section{Program Inputs}
\label{sec:inputs}

The executable MARGE.py is the driver for the MARGE program. It takes a 
a configuration file of parameters.  Once configured, MARGE is executed via 
the terminal as described in Section \ref{sec:example}.


\subsection{MARGE Configuration File}
\label{sec:config}
The MARGE configuration file is the main file that sets the arguments for a 
MARGE run. The arguments follow the format {\ttb argument = value}, where 
{\ttb argument} is any of the possible arguments described below. Note that, 
if generating data via BART, the user must create a BART configuration file 
(see Section \ref{sec:BARTconfig}).

\noindent The available options for a MARGE configuration file are listed below.

\noindent \underline(Directories)
\begin{itemize}
\item inputdir   : str.  Directory containing MARGE inputs.
\item outputdir  : str.  Directory containing MARGE outputs.
\item plotdir    : str.  Directory to save plots. 
                         If relative path, subdirectory within `outputdir`.
\item datadir    : str.  Directory to store generated data. 
                         If relative path, subdirectory within `outputdir`.
\item preddir    : str.  Directory to store validation and test set predictions and true values. 
                         If relative path, subdirectory within `outputdir`.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \underline{Datagen Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
\item datagen    : bool. Determines whether to generate data.
\item datagenfile: str.  File containing functions to generate and/or process 
                         data.  Do NOT include the .py extension!
                         See the files in the lib/datagen directory for examples.
                         User-specified files must have identically-named 
                         functions with an identical set of inputs.  If an 
                         additional input is required, the user must modify the 
                         code in MARGE.py accordingly.  
                         Please submit a pull request if this occurs!
\item cfile      : str.  Name of the configuration file for data generation.

                          integers to selectively take the log of certain inputs.
\item olog        : bool. Determines whether to take the log10 of the output data.
                          Alternatively, specify comma-, space-, or newline-separated

                    `max\_lr` over `clr\_steps` iterations, then decreases.
                    'triangular2' performs similar to `triangular', except that 
                    the `max\_lr` value is decreased by 2 every complete cycle,
                    i.e., 2 * `clr\_steps`.
                    'exp\_range' performs similar to 'triangular2', except that 
                    the amplitude decreases according to an exponential based 
                    on the epoch number, rather than the CLR cycle.
\item clr\_steps  : int.   Number of steps through a half-cycle of the learning rate.
                    E.g., if using clr\_mode = 'triangular' and clr\_steps = 4, 
                    Every 8 epochs will have the same learning rate.
                    It is recommended to use an even value.
                    For more details, see Smith (2015), Cyclical Learning Rates 
                    for Training Neural Networks.

                   Used to compute statistics for band-integrated values.
\item filt2um : float. (default: 1.0) Factor to convert the filter files' 
                       X values to microns.

\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{BART Configuration File}
\label{sec:BARTconfig}

The BART User Manual details the creation of a BART configuration file.  For 
compatibility with MARGE, users must ensure two specific arguments are set 
within the configuration file:
\begin{itemize}
\item savemodel: base file name of the generated data. MUST have '.npy' file 
                 extension.
\item modelper: an integer that sets the batch size of each `savemodel` file.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Note that `modelper` batch size corresponds to the iterations per 
chain.  For example, if using 10 parallel chains, a `modelper` of 512 would 
save out files of 5120 spectra each.

\noindent  Executing BART requires a Transit Line-Information (TLI) file to 
be created.  For details on generating a TLI file, see the Transit User Manual.
For an example, see Section \ref{sec:example}.



\section{Program Outputs}
\label{sec:outputs}

MARGE produces the following outputs if all modes are executed:

\begin{itemize}
\item simulated spectra.npy files
\item processed spectra.npy files
\item .NPY file of the mean of training set inputs and outputs
\item .NPY file of the standard deviation of training set inputs and outputs
\item .NPY file of the minima of training set inputs and outputs
\item .NPY file of the maxima of training set inputs and outputs
\item .NPY file of the size of the training, validation, and test sets
\item TFRecords files of the data set
\item file containing the NN model and weights
\item predicted and true spectra
\item RMSE and R\^2 statistics
\item plots of true and predicted spectra
\end{itemize}

\noindent Note that BART's output files are not discussed here; see the BART 
User Manual for details.
