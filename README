Summary
=======
MARGE is an all-in-one package to generate exoplanet spectra across a 
defined parameter space, process the output, and train machine learning (ML) 
models as a fast approximation to radiative transfer (RT).

MARGE comes with complete documentation as well as a user manual to assist 
in its usage.  Users can find the latest MARGE User Manual at 
https://exosports.github.io/MARGE/doc/MARGE_User_Manual.html.

MARGE is an open-source project that welcomes improvements from the community 
to be submitted via pull requests on Github.  To be accepted, such improvements 
must be generally consistent with the existing coding style, and all changes 
must be updated in associated documentation.

MARGE is released under the Reproducible Research Software License.  Users are 
free to use the software for personal reasons.  Users publishing results from 
MARGE or modified versions of it in a peer-reviewed journal are required to 
publicly release all necessary code/data to reproduce the published work.  
Modified versions of MARGE are required to also be released open source under 
the same Reproducible Research Software License.  For more details, see the 
text of the license.

Installation
============
At present, MARGE uses BART, the Bayesian Atmospheric Radiative Transfer
(BART) code, for data generation.  For details, see the associated user manual 
in the modules/BART/doc directory.

To build the included conda environment, enter 
    conda env create -f environment.yml
into a terminal.  Then, activate it via 
    conda activate marge

If running MARGE in data generation mode, users must first compile BART's 
submodules. This can be done by entering
    make bart
into a terminal while in the MARGE directory.
This requires SWIG.  If the user does not have SWIG installed, they 
can easily add SWIG to the current conda environment by entering
    conda install swig
into the terminal.

Note that the supplied conda environment does not include SWIG.  Also note 
that it uses tensorflow-gpu, which assumes the user has Nvidia drivers 
installed.  If this is not the case, after building the environment, non-GPU 
users must enter 
    conda remove -n marge tensorflow-gpu
and follow the prompts.  This will remove the requirement for Nvidia drivers.

For more details, see the MARGE User Manual.


Executing MARGE
===============
MARGE has 2 execution modes: data generation, and ML model training.

As mentioned above, data generation is handled via BART.
Before data generation can begin, users must first generate a TLI file via 
pylineread, BART's line list-processing code.  To do so, input
    make TLI cfile=<path/to/configration file>
to call pylineread with a configuration file.  For details on how to set this 
up, see the pylineread directory within BART's RT module, transit.

After generating a TLI file, data generation can begin.  After setting up the 
MARGE configuration file, run MARGE via
    ./MARGE.py <path/to/configuration file>

Note that data generation requires a BART configuration file.  In order to save 
the data, the BART config file must have the 'savemodel' parameter set to 
<name>.npy.  This config file must also have the 'modelper' parameter set; this 
controls the number of iterations per chain to save out each model file, to 
ensure that the evaluated models will fit in memory.  If the models will fit in 
memory as a single array, set modelper=0 to save out a single file with all 
models.  If modelper>0, the generated .npy files will be saved to a subdirectory
within BART's output directory, named <name> from the 'savemodel' parameter.

For a detailed example walkthrough, see the README in the example/ subdirectory 
or the user manual.


ML Model Training: Data
-----------------------
If training an ML model using MARGE, data must be formatted a particular way.
At present, MARGE has a single allowed format, which is a 2D array saved as a 
.NPY file.  Each row corresponds to a unique case.  Each column corresponds to 
the inputs followed by the outputs, e.g.,
[input0, input1, input2, ..., output0, output1, output2, ...]

Users are encouraged to introduce additions to loader.py to allow additional 
data formats, which would be specified in the configuration file.  
Please submit any such modifications via pull requests on Github.


Setting Up a MARGE Configuration File
=====================================
A MARGE configuration file contains many options, which are detailed in this 
section.  For an example, see config.cfg in the example subdirectory, and the 
associated README with instructions on execution.

                   User-specified files must have identically-named 
                   functions with an identical set of inputs.  If an 
                   additional input is required, the user must modify the 
                   code in MARGE.py accordingly.

                    `max_lr` over `clr_steps` iterations, then decreases.
                    'triangular2' performs similar to `triangular', except that 
                    the `max_lr` value is decreased by 2 every complete cycle,
                    i.e., 2 * `clr_steps`.
                    'exp_range' performs similar to 'triangular2', except that 
                    the amplitude decreases according to an exponential based 
                    on the epoch number, rather than the CLR cycle.
clr_steps  : int.   Number of steps through a half-cycle of the learning rate.
                    E.g., if using clr_mode = 'triangular' and clr_steps = 4, 
                    Every 8 epochs will have the same learning rate.
                    It is recommended to use an even value.
